        <p style="text-align: center;"><small>TheClassTracker is an independent third-party service and is not affiliated with or associated with the University of South Florida. The app monitors open seats in university courses and sends prompt notifications to users; however, registration must be completed directly through the University’s official system by the student. Since class registration is managed by the University, TheClassTracker cannot offer a guarantee of acquiring a seat in the course.</small></p>
