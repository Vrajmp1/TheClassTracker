	<br>
	<li><b>Transparent pricing structure:</b> Other course-tracking platforms typically offer the first tracked course for free and then charge to upgrade the account to premium to track "unlimited courses." Truth is - no one needs to track unlimited courses! However, these platforms often send delayed messages to free-tier users in order to give their paying users an advantage. With TheClassTracker, our low per section pricing model allows us to remain both competitive and transparent and send priority messages to all our users while ensuring fairness to those serious about using the service.</li>
	<li><b>Minimalist and reliable design:</b>We've focused on the core tracking functionality and built simplicity into our design which allows us to operate efficiently with minimal costs to students. Specifically, our service is offered as a chatbot through Telegram. By leveraging Telegram's existing infrastructure, the service requires no additional downloads, offering seamless cross-platform compatibility and providing instant integration with a familiar interface. No login, no accounts, just open Telegram and start tracking!</li>
	<li><b>Speedy notifications:</b> We've optimized our querying algorithm to account for the number of users tracking a specific section and the total number of users tracking sections within particular departments, enabling us to deliver faster updates through the Telegram API compared to traditional app-based solutions. </li>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><small>TheClassTracker is an independent third-party service and is not affiliated with or associated with the University of South Florida. The app monitors open seats in university courses and sends prompt notifications to users; however, registration must be completed directly through the University’s official system by the student. Since class registration is managed by the University, TheClassTracker cannot offer a guarantee of acquiring a seat in the course.</small></p>
